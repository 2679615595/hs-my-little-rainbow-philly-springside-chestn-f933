#My Little Rainbow
In this tutorial we're going to make a rainbow with HTML `<div>` elements. And while we do it we're going to learn about html elements, css styling, css selectors, how color works in css, and importing stylesheets.

**1** First you'll need to open `index.html` in both Sublime Text and the browser. Notice it's completely empty in the browser. 
 
**2** Link `main.css` to `index.html` and refresh the browser. You should see a black rainbow.

**3** Select each div individially by adding an id to each one. You'll want to use that id as your CSS selector

**4** Add CSS in `main.css` using hexadecimal colors to add the correct colors to the rainbow (Red: `#f00`; Orange: `#ffa500`; Yellow: `#ff0`; Green: `#00bc3f`; Blue: `#06f`; Indigo: `#8a2be2`; Violet: `#d300c9`). The property you'll want to use is `border-top-color` property.
